    about:
      "Short-term inpatient hospitalization may be the right choice to help your loved one in an emergency. Short-term inpatient hospitalization is best for clients who are at immediate risk of harming themselves or others or who are experiencing severe psychosis. Because the goal of short-term inpatient hospitalization is to stabilize the client, not cure him/her, staff will focus on making a diagnosis and forming a longer-term treatment plan. Staff will also administer medical care, support, and supervision during the client’s stay. The hospitalization may also include therapeutic activities to help the client stabilize.",

      "At Emergency Hospital Systems, our emergency rooms are open 24/7/365, so we’re available when you need us most. We realize emergencies can’t wait, whether that’s a deep cut, broken bone, or medication overdose. When you come to one of the EHS emergency rooms, you’ll be seen by a caring and compassionate staff member. Depending on the severity of your emergency, we might show you into an exam room immediately or triage you with others. In all cases, however, we are generally able to see patients quickly, unlike the long waits experienced by patients at some of the large downtown hospitals",

      "General surgery is a discipline that requires knowledge of and responsibility for the preoperative, operative, and postoperative management of patients with a broad spectrum of diseases, including those which may require nonoperative, elective, or emergency surgical treatment. The breadth and depth of this knowledge may vary by disease category. Surgical management requires skill in complex decision making; general surgeons should be competent in diagnosis as well as treatment and management, including operative intervention.",

      "An x-ray, which is short for x-radiation, is a type of imaging test that has been utilized for years. With this technology, doctors can see your bones, muscle and more without having to make an incision. This helps them diagnose, treat and monitor a number of different medical conditions. Because the test uses a form of electromagnetic radiation, there are some risks involved in the procedure. However, the benefits far outweigh these potential risks.",

    about:
      "Family planning is sometimes used as a synonym or euphemism for access to and the use of contraception. However, it often involves methods and practices in addition to contraception. Additionally, many might wish to use contraception but are not necessarily planning a family (e.g., unmarried adolescents, young married couples delaying childbearing while building a career). Family planning has become a catch-all phrase for much of the work undertaken in this realm. However, contemporary notions of family planning tend to place a woman and her childbearing decisions at the center of the discussion, as notions of women's empowerment and reproductive autonomy have gained traction in many parts of the world. It is usually applied to a female-male couple who wish to limit the number of children they have or control pregnancy timing (also known as spacing children).",
